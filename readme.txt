1. Personal Turtle figuresIn order to be able to draw more varieties of shapes, I imported math. There are the some of my personal shapes explained: a. Gasket6: This is a recursive shape based on hexagons.  b. Doily: This is a variation of circle gaskets, with three smaller ones in a big one.c. Pentadoily: This is based on pentagons. It looks like a doily.d. Flower: This is based on octagons. Since octagons look like flowers, more octagons together make a flower.e. Cross: This is a variation of gasket4, but it doesn’t have the for loop.2. Personal Technical ContributionsApart from calculating and designing of the figures, there are several contributions in the interface:a. The “I’m feeling lucky;)” button is inspired by Google search which takes the user to a random search result. Combining “random” module, it generates random turtle figures with random shapes, orders, and lengths. I also gave a range to the order and length to avoid botched results. It also calls the update of the message box telling the user what is being drawn.b. I replaced the input entries with sliders, providing a plausible range of values for users to avoid unexpected results that may cause confusion. The default values are both 0, and new values will be shown after the sliders move.c. An error box will appear if the chosen length is 0. (The order can be 0 because some shapes can still be drawn.)d. A second frame was created for more settings, which are not essential to the drawing but are nice for users to have. These include changing turtle color, background color, and turtle shapes. So I imported color chooser for tkinter. The turtle shapes are radio button options because only one shape can be selected at one time.e. The message box display information of the current shape, length, and more information.
